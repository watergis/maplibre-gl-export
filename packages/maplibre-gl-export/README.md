# maplibre-gl-export

[![version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@watergis/maplibre-gl-export.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@watergis/maplibre-gl-export)

This module adds control which can export PDF and images. It was forked from [mapbox-gl-export](https://github.com/watergis/mapbox-gl-export).

This module is using source code of [mpetroff/print-maps](https://github.com/mpetroff/print-maps). I just adopted this library to normal Mapbox GL Plugin. Thanks so much to develop this library!

## Demo & usage

See [documentation](https://maplibre-gl-export.water-gis.com/).
