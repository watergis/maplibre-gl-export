Submit a new issue only if you are sure it is a missing feature or a bug.

## A quick guide for pull request:

1. [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and create a branch for your new feature or bug fix.

2. Run the plugins to check all of plugin's features work well. Run: `npm run dev`

3. Make sure you submit a change specific to exactly one issue. If you have ideas for multiple changes please create separate pull requests.

4. Make eslint pass. Run: `npm run lint`

5. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests). A button should
appear on your fork its github page afterwards.
